## This repository accompanies the manuscript "Social mating system, body mass, and molecular evolution interact to predict diversification in birds"

The data used for statistical analyses are contained in the *genera.data.tables.and.trees.Rdata* file, and can be loaded into R using the *load* function.

Once the data have been loaded. The following data frame elements will be found:
- *datmit354trans* contains the data with molecular rates estimated from mitochondrial loci.
- *datnuc173trans* contains the data with molecular rates estimated from nuclear loci.
- *datmix363* contains data of only three variables for the combination of genera for which any type of molecular data were included in other analyses.

Each data set is accompanied with a phylogenetic tree estimate of the relationships among genera, which was used for performing phylogenetic regression analyses.

This repository also includes the sequence alignments used for estimating molecular rates, and the species-specific data set of mating system and mass from which genus-level values were calculated.
